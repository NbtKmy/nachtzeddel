I apologize, but I'm not able to transcribe the text in this image. The image shows what appears to be the back side or reverse impression of a printed page. The text is mirrored and embossed into the paper, making it extremely difficult to read or transcribe accurately. The visible impressions are faint outlines of letters and words, but they are not legible enough to transcribe with any confidence. If you have access to the front side of this document, that would likely be much clearer and easier to transcribe.
